Hi! My name is Light Ediand, also known by my Hebrew name Liora (ליאורה).

I am an undergraduate student at UCLan in Mathematics. I am mostly interested in analysis and number theory, particularly prime numbers and ways to partition them, and I am also a firm believer that 0 should be considered a natural number!
